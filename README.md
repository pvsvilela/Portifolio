# Paulo Valentino Santos Vilela — Portfolio (concept)

Static, responsive portfolio concept built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. The theme is a train journey through Paulo's career with a dark-first palette and optional light mode.

## Pages
- `index.html`: main portfolio with hero, about, skills, experience train cars, projects placeholders, education, and contact.
- `design-system.html`: token reference, typography, layout rules, and component previews for developer handoff.

## Getting started
Open `index.html` in a browser. Theme selection persists via `localStorage` and respects OS preferences.

## Structure & accessibility
- Uses semantic sections, skip link, focus outlines, and reduced-motion support.
- Responsive grid/flex layout with consistent spacing tokens.
- Contact form is ready for API/automation wiring (e.g., Make webhook).
